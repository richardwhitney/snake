 * Description: A simple version of the game snake. The player controlls the snake around the screen with the up, down, left and right keys
 *              The objective of the game is to eat the apples that appear on the screen. When the snake eats an apple the player's score is increased and the snake grows
 *              The game is lost if the snake collides with an edge of the screen of itself
 *              A list of high scores can be displayed and the list is saved to a file called 'highscores.txt' so that they are persistant 
 *
 * Structure of Code: The use of String methods can be seen in the files related to player scores
 *                    If statements are used throughout the assignment
 *                    Loops are used throughout the assignment
 *                    The use of processing methods can be seen in the GameController class
 *                    Bespoke methods are used throughout the assignment
